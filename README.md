cmd-game
========
A game to test your knowledge of your UNIX-like system.

This game will give you a letter and you have to enter a command that starts with that letter. 
If you get it wrong, then you lose your turn. 
Be careful though, because if you repeat a command, you lose a point!

This game is also personalized to your current system. 
That means that if you try to guess "yum" or "rpm" on a Debian-based system (or "aptitude," "apt-get," or "dpkg*" on an rpm-based distribution), you won't get any points!
